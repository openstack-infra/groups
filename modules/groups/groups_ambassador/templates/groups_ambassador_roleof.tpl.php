<p>Ambassadors will be recognised on the OpenStack website for their
efforts, and provided with support from foundation staff to conduct their
duties. They will also get access to a funding program – allowing them to
request funds for activities of impact in their region. We’d also expect
ambassadors to attend the summits, and the Foundation would likely assist
if it wasn’t possible for them to be there using their own methods.</p>
