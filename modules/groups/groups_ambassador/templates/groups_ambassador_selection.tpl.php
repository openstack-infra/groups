<p>The Ambassador title is designed to recognise those who are already good leaders
with a proven track record in the community. If you want to become an Ambassador,
you should start by doing good work - not requesting the title!
 The title is designed so that new users, contributors and community members should
easily be able to recognize their Ambassador as a go-to resource.
While the role provides inherent credibility, it also comes with accountability,
meaning decisions and actions made by the Ambassador should benefit the whole community,
not just one person or company.</p>
<p>We believe that the Ambassadors will already be active participants in our community. Think about those people who are already working across multiple user groups, submitting OpenStack mini-events to related conferences, helping onboard new users and contributors, arranging hackfests or just generally going above and beyond in the name of making Openstack great.
</p>
<p>To that end, we intend to ask that potential ambassadors provide some information about themselves, namely:
</p>
<ul><li> Why are you applying to become an OpenStack Ambassador?</li>
<li> How have you participated in the OpenStack Community to date?</li>
<li> What ideas do you have for your community, that you wish you had time or resources to implement?</li></ul>
<p>A small number of ambassadors will then be selected based on a set of criteria:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Community participation track record</li>
  <li> Geographical location</li>
  <li> Potential impact of selection on community</li>
</ul>
