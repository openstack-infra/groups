<h3>When is all this going to happen?</h3>
<p>The Ambassador program was launched in August 2013. </p>
<h3>How much do ambassadors get paid?</h3>
<p>hey are paid in love – this is a volunteer position.</p>
<h3>How big will the regions each Ambassador covers be?</h3>
<p>Initially: big. We’re starting with a small number of ambassadors so we can
learn before scaling up. We also want to avoid situations where there are many
ambassadors in one region – hence the selection criteria related to geography.
</p>
<h3>How does “Ambassador” relate to “User Group Leader”?</h3>

<p>OpenStack Ambassador and OpenStack User Group leader are two distinct roles, which can of course be fulfilled by one person, but they have distinct responsibilities. The Ambassador may be involved in running their local meetup group, but with their Ambassador hat on they’ll be chatting to the User Group Leaders in their region about how to best help – not taking over!
</p>
<h3>What will the term length be for ambassadors?</h3>

<p>It’s a ‘job for life’. We believe that the kinds of people who would be eligible to be ambassadors will know when to step down gracefully.
</p>
<h3>How will we manage misuse of the ambassador title?</h3>

<p>This question comes up frequently, but we have faith in our community. We’ll be applying selection criteria to weed out any undesirables at the beginning, but then keeping in constant contact with the ambassadors to look for early signs things aren’t going the right way. Community members are also welcome to help us looking out for misuse of the title.
